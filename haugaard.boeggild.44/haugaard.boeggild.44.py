    # see e) 5.5 in the code above for implementation,

    # Yes, yes it does!
    # We expected the image to improve for each iteration, removing noise in each iteration,
    # looking at the curve, in the lower plot, it is clear that the first few iterations causes
    # the calculated value to drop, illustrating the step by step improvements bringing
    # our image closer to an "optimal" noise reduced image.

#g)
    # What effect does the size of lambda have on the algorithm in e)?
    # The size of lambda will determine how big an effect the noise found in the image, will effect the image itself.
    # If set too high, there will be almost no different, as the values on which the iterations are done, will be too
    # high for proper noise detection, the difference between the values will be relatively low compared to the values
    # themselves. If lambda is set too low however, every little change in value between neighboring pixels will seem
    # huge, and most of the image will be determined as noise, causing more harm than good.
